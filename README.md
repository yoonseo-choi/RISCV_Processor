# RISC-V Processor

Design inspired by the following references:

*edX: Building a RISC-V CPU Core* from Linux Foundation.

*Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware Software Interface* by D.A. Patterson and J.L. Hennessy

## Documents

Contains the reference materials for the the implementation of the project.

## Library

Includes all universal systemverilog modules and hardware components used by the microarchitecture, i.e. D Flip-Flop, Register, Adder, etc.

## Source

Compilation of all architecture specific hardware units and top level design.

## Test Code

Code in this folder used to provide reference for test assembly instructions to exercise different parts of the datapath.

## Testbenches

Includes all testbench modules used to perform functional simulation and verify all DUTs.
